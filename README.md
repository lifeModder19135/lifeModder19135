# Hello World, my name is Nate T., and I heart software development!

 ## Welcome to my tutorials Plus repo...

 This is where I keep the code any time I want to mess around with a coding concept. This was started out of necessity. One day, a few months ago, I spent hours deleting scores of 'trash' repos from my main account. It had become unusable.

 Due to copyright concerns, I have recently privatized the repos on my main account. For this reason, I will brobably use this one any time I need to "show my work" (on my resume, to prospective clients, etc.)

 ## Learning for the Sake of Learning...

 I am wierd in that I LOVE coding tutorials. In fact, I have spent thousands of dollars on kgoogle Play Books just on coding books. Just last week, I bought a book on java, and I have been using Java for more than a decade now. I did this because I enjoy looking at coding concepts (and languages) from a different point of view. I find that, where software development is concerned, there is always more to explore. Honestly, I enjoy learning even more than I enjoy applying said knowledge.
