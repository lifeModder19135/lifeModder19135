## Hello World, my name is Nate T., and I heart software development!

I do not have anything important to share here. I just found out that I could add profile README to github, and since this is my 'mess around' profile, it just seems fitting.

 ## Welcome to my Experiments Plus repo...

 This is where I keep the code any time I want to mess around with a coding concept. I started pushing projects here of necessity. One day, a few months ago, I spent hours
 deleting scores of 'trash' repos from my main account. It had become unusable. I started to make a second account for unimportant 'hobby' projects (unrelated to work/community
 projects) when I realized that I already had a four year old forgotten account! I dont even remember making it, but from here on out, it is my throwaway / experimental / learning
 new stuff account. I also plan to keep a lot of boilerplate and template projects here. For example, I am currently messing around with different Spring boot rest backends, so
 you will likely see a lot of that.

 Due to copyright concerns, I have recently privatized the repos on my main account. For this reason, I will brobably also use this one any time I need to "show my work" (on my
 resume, to prospective clients, etc.)

 ## Learning for the Sake of Learning...

 I am wierd in that I LOVE coding tutorials. In fact, I have spent thousands of dollars on kgoogle Play Books just on coding books. Just last week, I bought a book on java, and I
 have been using Java for more than a decade now. I did this because I enjoy looking at coding concepts (and languages) from a different point of view. I find that, where software
 development is concerned, there is always more to explore. Honestly, I enjoy learning even more than I enjoy applying said knowledge.
